	/**
	 * Consider a call of the detach attribute of a block instance X.
	 * <p>
	 * If X is an instance of a prefixed block the detach statement has no
	 * effect. Assume that X is a class object. The following cases arise:
	 * <ol>
	 * <li>X is an attached object.<br>
	 * If X is not operating the detach statement constitutes an error. Assume X
	 * is operating. The effect of the detach statement is:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>X becomes detached and thereby (the head of) a new non-operative
	 * object component, its reactivation point positioned immediately after the
	 * detach statement. As a consequence, that part of the operating chain
	 * which is dynamically enclosed by X becomes the (non-operating)
	 * reactivation chain of X.
	 * 
	 * <li>The PSC returns to the block instance to which X was attached and
	 * execution continues immediately after the associated object generator or
	 * call statement (see 7.3.2).
	 * </ul>
	 * If X is local to a system head, the new component becomes a member of the
	 * associated system. It is a consequence of the language definition that,
	 * prior to the execution of the detach statement, X was dynamically
	 * enclosed by the head of the operative component of this system. The
	 * operative component remains operative.
	 * 
	 * <li>X is a detached object.<br>
	 * The detach statement then constitutes an error.
	 * 
	 * <li>X is a resumed object.<br>
	 * X is then (the head of) an operative system component. Let S be the
	 * associated system. It is a consequence of the language definition that X
	 * must be operating. The effect of the detach statement is:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>X enters the detached state and becomes non-operative, its
	 * reactivation point positioned immediately after the detach statement. As
	 * a consequence, that part of the operating chain which is dynamically
	 * enclosed by X becomes the (non-operating) reactivation chain of X.
	 * 
	 * <li>The PSC is moved to the current reactivation point of the main
	 * component of S, whereby this main component becomes operative and
	 * operating. As a consequence, all block instances on the reactivation
	 * chain of the main component also become operating.
	 * </ul>
	 * <li>X is a terminated object.<br>
	 * The detach statement then constitutes an error.
	 * </ol>
	 * </ul>
