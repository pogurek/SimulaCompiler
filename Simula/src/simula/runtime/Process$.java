 * An object of a class prefixed by "process" is called a process object. A
 * process object has the properties of "link" and, in addition, the capability
 * to be represented in the sequencing set and to be manipulated by certain
 * sequencing statements which may modify its "process state". The possible
 * process states are: active, suspended, passive and terminated.
 * <p>
 * When a process object is generated it immediately becomes detached and its
 * reactivation point positioned in front of the first statement of its user-
 * defined operation rule. The process object remains detached throughout its
 * dynamic scope.
 * <p>
 * The procedure "idle" has the value true if the process object is not
 * currently represented in the sequencing set. It is said to be in the passive
 * or terminated state depending on the value of the procedure "terminated". An
 * idle process object is passive if its reactivation point is at a user-defined
 * prefix level. If and when the PSC passes through the final end of the
 * user-defined part of the body, it proceeds to the final operations at the
 * prefix level of the class "process", and the value of the procedure
 * "terminated" becomes true. (Although the process state "terminated" is not
 * strictly equivalent to the corresponding basic concept defined in chapter 7,
 * an implementation may treat a terminated process object as terminated in the
 * strict sense). A process object currently represented in the sequencing set
 * is said to be "suspended", unless it is represented by the event notice at
 * the lower end of the sequencing set. In the latter case it is active. A
 * suspended process is scheduled to become active at the system time indicated
 * by the attribute EVTIME of its event notice. This time value may be accessed
 * through the procedure "evtime". The procedure "nextev" references the process
 * object, if any, represented by the next event notice in the sequencing set.
